### Plutonian Pebbles

You find a line of stones on Pluto with numbers engraved on them. These stones change every time you blink, following these rules:

1. **If the number is `0`:** It becomes `1`.
2. **If the number has an even number of digits:** It splits into two stones. The left half of the digits goes on one stone, and the right half on the other.
3. **Otherwise:** The stone's number is multiplied by `2024`.

The stones always stay in order.

Starting with a given arrangement of stones, how many stones will there be after:

1. **25 blinks**: es.usj.day11.StoneTransformation
2. **75 blinks**: es.usj.day11.PlutoStonesPart2
